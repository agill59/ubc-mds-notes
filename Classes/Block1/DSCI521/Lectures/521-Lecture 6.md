## Quarto Documents

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
is a newer scientific and technical publishing system that aims to combine
the best features of a Jupyter Notebook and an R Markdown document.
It uses markdown, code chunks (similar to R Markdown), and `pandoc`
to create various output formats.
If you need another Markdown resource,
the Quarto documentation has its own
[markdown basics guide](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html).

*Quarto documents are created with text and Python, R and/or Julia code*

### Jupyter Notebooks for Python and RMarkdown for R?

Historically,
Jupyter Notebooks were designed for Python and R Markdown documents were designed for R.
These days,
there are [many different Jupyter Kernels](https://gist.github.com/chronitis/682c4e0d9f663e85e3d87e97cd7d1624)
you can install,
and R Markdown documents can also support
[many different language engines](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/language-engines.html).
Quarto natively supports Python, R, Julia, and Javascript,
but can also
[leverage all of the Jupyter kernels](https://quarto.org/docs/faq/#what-programming-languages-are-supported-in-quarto)
to run more languages.

If you want a single document to run multiple languages (R and Python),
Python can run R via the `rpy2` Python package,
and
R can run Python via the `reticulate` R package.
Quarto will leverage `knitr` and `reticulate` to run documents that need to run
both R and Python.


### Github `README.md`

If you need to document code and output in your `README.md` file,
you can create a Quarto `README.qmd` document that can be rendered into a
github-flavored markdown `README.md` file.

In Quarto, you will need to set the output format in the YAML to:

```yaml
output: gfm
```

This process is similar to R Markdown documents rendering from `README.Rmd` file.
The main difference here is that in R Markdown you will be using a different output
format string:

```yaml
output: github_document
```

## Lecture 6 Activity 2

Why does using R Markdown and Quarto documents make your work more reproducible?

A. `.Rmd` and `.qmd` are plain-text files; they can be opened and edited with almost any editor.

B. Including text in the final reports created involves a more detailed explanation of your work than only commenting on the code.

C. They use Pandoc to render the files in different formats.

D. Because they create a versatile `.md` file as an intermediate step.

E. They allow running code as inline code or in code chunks.

:::{.activity}
## Lecture 6 Activity 3

Now that youâ€™ve completed your reproducible report, imagine you need to present this work to a real-world audience, such as at a conference, to your boss, or an executive group. Let's use that example above again:

- R: <https://github.com/ttimbers/breast_cancer_predictor>
- Python: <https://github.com/ttimbers/breast_cancer_predictor_py>

How would you use tools like PowerPoint or Word documents to effectively present your findings and pitch your ideas? Consider elements such as visualizations, narrative, and the overall format of the report.

Discuss with your partner and prepare to share your strategies with the class. Could there be a more efficient way of doing this directly within your Markdown files? What challenges might you encounter, such as issues with reproducibility?

## Presentations with JupyterLab, RMarkdown and Quarto

You can create a great set of slides to share your results with others!

We are going to use the framework `reveal.js`. RMarkdown most popular slides are created with a package called `xaringan`. Since Quarto appear, it is possible to create slides using `reveal.js` that is the same framework that is available by default in Jupyter Notebooks. Anyway, it would be possible to generate `reveal.js` presentations with RMarkdown if you install the `revealjs` package and follow [these instructions](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/revealjs.html).


### Quarto

Clicking here you can have
[an example](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/demo/#/title-slide)
of what you can do with Quarto presentations using `reveal.js` framework.

In the YAML header, you will need to change the `format` option to `revealjs`.

```yaml
format: revealjs
```

```markdown
{{< include demos/slides/slides-quarto.qmd >}}
```

{{< revealjs "demos/slides/slides-quarto.html" height="600px" class="ratio ratio-16x9" >}}

If you want to create your `revealjs` html slides and be able to share
a **single** html file with others as a slide,
you may need to embed and make the slide "self contained".

```yaml
format:
  revealjs:
    embed-resources: true

```

This puts all the external resources for the HTML document inside the HTML file.
Otherwise your slides would need to travel in a zip file
with all the external resources in the same directory.
You will typically need this when sharing slides that have images
and computation in them.
You may notice additional folders created in the directory as a cue
that you may need to think about embedding your resources to make
the slides self-contained, depending on how you will use and share them.


### R Markdown

R Markdown has been around for a long time, and has many output formats.
The defaults that come with R Markdown are less popular than formats
you need to install.

We'll show you how you can create a `reaveal.js` and `xaringan` presentation,
but you may need to install a few packages first.

```r
install.packages(c('xaringan', 'revealjs'))
```

#### Reveal.js

```yaml
output: revealjs::revealjs_presentation
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| include: false

rmarkdown::render(here::here("lectures/demos/slides/slides-rmd.Rmd"))
```

```markdown
{{< include demos/slides/slides-rmd.Rmd >}}
```

{{< revealjs "demos/slides/slides-rmd.html" height="600px" class="ratio ratio-16x9" >}}

#### Xaringan

Many people who are still working with R Markdown documents,
will create their slides using `{xaringan}`.
This lessons uses `reveal.js` for R Markdown slides to keep the output
type consistent.

If you want to learn more about Xaringan slides, see the
[Xaringan Slides Chapter](../appendix/xaringan_slides.qmd)

:::{.activity}
## Lecture 6 Activity 4

Which of the following is the **correct** output format for creating slides in R Markdown?

A. `revealjs::revealjs_presentation`

B. `xaringan::sun_reader`

C. `quarto::quarto_presentation`

D. `ioslides_presentation`

:::


:::{.activity}
## Lecture 6 Activity 5

What is the primary difference between slides created with R Markdown's `revealjs` and `xaringan`?

A. `xaringan` slides are two-dimensional, allowing horizontal and vertical navigation, while `reveal.js` slides are one-dimensional.

B. `reveal.js` requires an additional package to be installed, while `xaringan` is included by default in R Markdown.

C. `reveal.js` slides support two-dimensional navigation, with slides moving left/right and sub-slides up/down.

D. `xaringan` uses `pandoc` for rendering slides, whereas `reveal.js` does not.

### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks also support slides with RISE.

<https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise>


You can use Jupyter Lab interface too with the same purpose.
You can read more [about it here](https://towardsdatascience.com/5-slides-for-tips-on-presentation-mode-in-jupyter-notebook-f858b15fff4f)

<!--![Jupyter Slides](img/jupyter-slides.gif)-->

The main page for RISE is here: <https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise>
Where you can find the command to install it:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab_rise
```

To mark which code cells should be part of the presentation,
we can go to the property inspector (the settings wheel in the left side panel)
and then select the slide type from the dropdown menu.

![](img/jupyter-rise-slide_type.png)

Once you are done marking up slides,
you can export them to
reveal.js presentations are two dimensional,
with slides in the horizontal direction
and sub-slides in the vertical direction.

- `Slide`: Standard slide navigated to via left and right arrows.
- `Sub-slide`: Sub-topic of a slide, navigated to via up and down arrows.
- `Fragment`: Animated in as part of the previous slide, could e.g. be a bullet point in a list.
- `-` (or empty): Will appear in the same cell as the previous slide.
- `Notes`: Speaker notes are visible when you press `t`
- `Skip`: Not included

You will notice that images that are referenced via `![]()` or `<img>` do not show up in the exported slides
(or the exported HTML).
Until [this issue](https://github.com/jupyter/nbconvert/issues/1057) is fixed,
a workaround is to paste the image into a Markdown cell
and it will be included as an attachment,
which shows up fine in HTML and slide exports.

To run your RISE slides in jupyter lab,
there is a small button on the top.

![](img/jupyter-rise-launch.png)

```{r}
#| include: false
system(
    "jupyter nbconvert demos/slides/slides-rise.ipynb --to slides"
)
```

{{< revealjs "demos/slides/slides-rise.slides.html" height="600px" class="ratio ratio-16x9" >}}

## Book output

Jupyter, R Markdown, and Quarto also have "book" outputs.
This is a special website format that can also be converted into PDFs and ePUB files
for physical book publishing.

- Jupyter Book: <https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html>
- Bookdown (R Markdown): <https://bookdown.org/>
- Quarto Book: <https://quarto.org/docs/books/>

The course materials does not use the official Quarto book layout,
it actually uses a regular Quarto website layout.
This is because books will have certain limitations because it needs to be
able to render into a format for physical publishing.
Quarto is a flexiable tool that has many kinds of output formats.
You can learn more about each in the official Quarto Guides:
<https://quarto.org/docs/guide/>


## Putting it all together

Here's an example of a workshop given by the MDS teaching team at the
Statistical Society of Canada conference:

- Repo: <https://github.com/UBC-STAT/ssc-workshop-2024>
- Site: <https://ubc-stat.github.io/ssc-workshop-2024/>

You will see in the repository that we have leveraged many of the skills
taught in the class so far:

- Quarto websites
- Quarto slides
- Git + GitHub Pages for website publishing
- `.gitignore` files

:::{.exercise}
## Exercise 1

Take 5 minutes of the class and convert one of your `.Rmd`, `.qmd` or `.ipynb` to a set of slides.

You can convert the slides manually or look into the
[jupytext](https://jupytext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) or
`quarto convert` tools
to do an initial file conversion.
