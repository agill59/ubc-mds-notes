### 2. Using the command line to navigate your filesystem

Below are some questions to check-in on your understanding of the 3 key commands we need to navigate your filesystem (`cd`, `ls` and `pwd`), as well as some other concepts that are needed to succesfully do this.

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### Question 2.1

rubric={reasoning:1}

With your own words and in 1-2 sentences, describe what the `cd` command does.
If there is a default behaviour for this command (behaviour when no argument is given), also describe that.

cd stands for change directory. cd by default puts you into the home directory. With a path argument to a directory, sets the current working directory to the specified directory.

<!-- END QUESTION -->

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### Question 2.2

rubric={reasoning:1}

With your own words and in 1-2 sentences, describe what the `pwd` command does. If there is a default behaviour for this command (behaviour when no argument is given), also describe that.

pwd stands for print working directory. With no arugment, prints the current working directory.

<!-- END QUESTION -->

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### Question 2.3

rubric={reasoning:1}

With your own words and in 1-2 sentences, describe what the `ls` command does. If there is a default behaviour for this command (behaviour when no argument is given), also describe that.

ls stands for list. Lists all files and subdirectories in current working directory when no argument is given. If path argument to a directory is given, lists all files and subdirectories for specified directory.

<!-- END QUESTION -->

### Question 2.4

rubric={autograde:1}

If `pwd` results in `/Users/tiffany/data/`, which of the following commands could Tiffany use to navigate to her home directory, which is `/Users/tiffany`?

A. `cd .`

B. `cd /`

C. `cd tiffany`

D. `cd ..`

*Assign your answer to an object called `answer_14`. Make sure your answer is an uppercase letter and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"F"`).*

```python
answer_14 = "D"
```

```python
grader.check("q24")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q24</pre></strong> passed! âœ¨</p>

### Question 2.5

rubric={autograde:1}

Using the filesystem diagram below, if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup/`, what will `ls ..` display?

A. `..: No such file or directory`

B. `thing/ backup/`

C. `Users/`

D. `original/ pnas_final/ pnas_sub/`

*Assign your answer to an object called `answer_15`. Make sure your answer is an uppercase letter and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"F"`).*



```python
answer_15 = "B"
```

```python
grader.check("q25")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q25</pre></strong> passed! ðŸŒŸ</p>

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### Question 2.6

rubric={reasoning:2}

After running the command `pwd` we get the following output: `C:/Users/Florencia/dashboard`. Complete the table below with the equivalent command but using an absolute path. The first row is complete as an example:

| Relative path                | Absolute path                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `cd shiny-app`             | 1.`cd /Users/Florencia/dashboard/shiny-app` |
| `cd ../../Varada/571-labs` | 2.`cd`                                      |
| `cd ..`                    | 3.`cd`                                      |
| `cd `                      | 4.`cd`                                      |
| `cd /`                     | 5.`cd`                                      |
| `cd ~/notes`               | 6.`cd`                                      |
| `cd ~/..`                  | 7.`cd`                                      |
| `cd ~/../../Data/mds_2022` | 8.`cd`                                      |

You can check [The Carpentries Glosario](https://glosario.carpentries.org/en/) to learn about more terms or to read the full description of each item.

Since example and question both used `dashboard` unlike the photo that states `dashboards`, will use `dashboard`

| Relative path                | Absolute path                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `cd shiny-app`             | 1.`cd /Users/Florencia/dashboard/shiny-app` |
| `cd ../../Varada/571-labs` | 2.`cd /Users/Varada/571_labs`               |
| `cd ..`                    | 3.`cd /Users/Florencia`                     |
| `cd `                      | 4.`cd /Users/Florencia`                     |
| `cd /`                     | 5.`cd /`                                    |
| `cd ~/notes`               | 6.`cd /Users/Florencia/notes`               |
| `cd ~/..`                  | 7.`cd /Users/Florencia`                     |
| `cd ~/../../Data/mds_2022` | 8.`cd /Data/mds_2022`                       |

### Question 2.7: setting your SSH keys

rubric={mechanics:2}

Follow the instructions on [how to setup SSH authentication with GitHub for your operating system](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent).

When you have setup your keys, run ssh -T `git@github.ubc.ca` from a terminal. If the message says that you have successfully authenticated take a screenshot of your terminal showing both the input and the output and paste it below this cell. It should look similar to this:



1. **Check Your Remote URLs:**

   - In your current local repo folder, open a terminal and type:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - Take note of the URLs that appear.
2. **Determine URL Type:**

   - **If the URLs start with `https://`**:
     You are using HTTPS. Create a new folder on your computer and clone your lab repo into this folder using the **SSH** URL instead.
   - **If the URLs start with `git@`**:
     You are using SSH. Create a new folder on your computer and clone your lab repo into this folder using the **HTTPS** URL instead.
3. **Verify Remote URLs in the New Folder:**

   - After cloning the repo into your new folder, open a terminal in that folder and type:
     ```bash
     git remote -v
     ```
   - Copy and paste the URLs from both the SSH and HTTPS remotes below.
4. **Explain the Difference:**

   - After pasting the URLs, provide a brief explanation of the difference between using SSH and HTTPS for cloning.



2. URL starts with git@, will now clone using HTTPS

3a) HTTPS:

origin	https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab1_agill59.git (fetch)

origin	https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab1_agill59.git (push)

3b) SSH:

origin	git@github.ubc.ca:mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab1_agill59.git (fetch)

origin	git@github.ubc.ca:mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab1_agill59.git (push)

4. SSH uses public and private keys that are encrypted using the RSA cryptosystem (# Lecture 2 DSCI 521 notes) while HHTPS uses password authentication. This is less secure due to the much less encrpyted and the prevalence of patterns that can exist.

### 3. Git and GitHub

In class we introduced Git and GitHub to access, log changes, and submit your homework. Below are some multiple choice questions to check-in on your understanding of the key commands needed to do this (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push` and `pull`), as well other key concepts.

### Question 3.1

rubric={autograde:6}

Now you know the basics of the Git/GitHub workflows!

In this assignment you are going to create a repository and interact with it.
We suggest you to do so to practice the steps at the same time you answer the questions.

First, let's to match some of the new terms we have learned through this chapter with a related concept/word.
Assign the variable the corresponding lower-case letter. The letter should be encased in "".

|                                   | related concept / word |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| one. Git repository               | a. The staging area    |
| two. Remote repository location   | b.`.git` folder      |
| three. Git add                    | c.`git pull`         |
| four. Clone a repository          | d. GitHub              |
| five. Update the local repository | e. SSH keys            |

Complete the following sentences selecting one of the following options.
Assign the variable with the corresponding right string. The string should be encased in "".

- **If you are working on the remote you are using [six].**

  - git
  - github
  - jupyterlab
  - the terminal
    `<br /><br />`
- **One of the benefits of using version control is that you can [seven].**

  - open your files using VS Code
  - have a back up of your code
  - track the history of your project
    `<br /><br />`
- **The expression "[eight] to GitHub" is referring to the step when you update the GitHub repository with the local changes.**

  - pulling
  - pushing
  - cloning
    `<br /><br />`
- **You record a new version of your project each time you [nine] your changes.**

  - commit
  - stage
  - push
  - clone
    `<br /><br />`
- **The HASH is a string of characters that serves as [ten].**

  - commit identifier
  - Git repository identifier
  - commit message
    `<br /><br />`
- **If you create a new file into a Git repository, its status will be [eleven].**

  - changed
  - untracked
  - staged
  - committed
    `<br /><br />`
- **If you want to check how many files do you have in the staging area you have to run the command [twelve].**

  - git add
  - git status
  - git log
  - git commit
    `<br /><br />`

*Assign your answer to an object called `one`. Make sure your answer is a lowercase letter/word and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"b"` or `"git pull"`).

```python
...

one = "b"
two = "d"
three = "a"
four = "e"
five = "c"
six = "github"
seven = "track the history of your project"
eight = "pushing"
nine = "commit"
ten = "commit identifier"
eleven = "untracked"
twelve = "git status"

```

```python
grader.check("q31")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q31</pre></strong> passed! ðŸŒŸ</p>

### Question 3.2

rubric={reasoning:1}

With your own words and in 1-2 sentences, explain why you should use `git clone` to get a copy of your homework (or other Git repositories) from GitHub as opposed to clicking on the "Download ZIP" link.

When we use git clone, it clones the most recent version of the remote repository and creates a local repository, giving access to the commit history. It can also allow changes to be made for it, given the right permissions and authentication.

### Question 3.3

rubric={autograde:1}

Which command(s) below would save the changes of `README.md` to my local Git repository?

A.`<br>`
`git init README.md<br>`
`git commit -m "Add authors and copyright"<br>``<br>`

B.`<br>`
`git commit -m "Add authors and copyright"<br>``<br>`

C.`<br>`
`git add README.md<br>`
`git commit -m "Add authors and copyright"<br>``<br>`

D.`<br>`
`git commit -m README.md "Add authors and copyright"<br>`

*Assign your answer to an object called `answer_33`. Make sure your answer is an uppercase letter and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"F"`).*

```python
answer_33 = "C"
```

```python
grader.check("q33")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q33</pre></strong> passed! ðŸ’¯</p>

### Question 3.4

rubric={reasoning:1}

With your own words and in 1-2 sentences, compare and contrast `git pull` and `git push`.

git push - pushes all committed changes from the local repository to the remote repository.

git pull - fetches the most recent changes from the remote repository and adds/changes the associated files in the local repository.

### Question 3.5

rubric={autograde:1}

When working on a project that is under version control (*e.g.,* MDS homework/labs) you should `commit` to you local Git repository:

A. after every new unit/addition/fix you add to the project

B. 2-3 times

C. only once, shortly before the deadline

D. obsessively, like every 5 minutes

*Assign your answer to an object called `answer_35`. Make sure your answer is an uppercase letter and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"F"`).*

```python

answer_35 = "A"
```

```python
grader.check("q35")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q35</pre></strong> passed! ðŸš€</p>

### Question 3.6

rubric={autograde:1}

When working on a project that is under version control (*e.g.,* MDS homework/labs) you should `push` to online GitHub repository:

A. obsessively, like every 5 minutes

B. at least at the end of every session you work on the project

C. 2-3 times

D. only once, shortly before the deadline

*Assign your answer to an object called `answer_36`. Make sure your answer is an uppercase letter and is surrounded by quotation marks (e.g. `"F"`).*

```python
answer_36 = "B"
```

```python
grader.check("q36")
```

<p><strong><pre style='display: inline;'>q36</pre></strong> passed! ðŸš€</p>

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### Question 3.7

#### Extra: Git + Globbing

rubric={reasoning:4.5}

In the past chapter we have learn how to use the shell. If you are using Git through the terminal you can benefit from from globbing and some of the operators we learned there.

Let's say that you have this files with changes on your GitHub repository:

```
2022-03-02_vancouver_site1.csv
2022-03-02_vancouver_site2.csv
2022-05-20_okenagan_site55.csv
```

but you only want to commit the changes in the files that say "Vancouver" as you are still waiting information to complete the last file with the data from Okenagan.

Select the correct answers (more than one option could be correct)

1 - How would you add to the staging area all the files including the word "vancouver" using the command line? Select all the correct answers.

A. `git add .`
B. `git add 2022-03-02_vancouver_site1.csv 2022-03-02_vancouver_site2.csv`
C. `git add *vancouver*`
D.
`git add 2022-03-02_vancouver_site1.csv`
`git add 2022-03-02_vancouver_site2.csv`

2 - From all the correct answers, which one you consider it would be more appropiate to use if instead of 3 files you would have 500 files?

A would add all 3 files, `wrong`

B would add both vancouver files, `correct`

C would use \*vancouver\* to find files that match that substring in their filename and add them as how B does. `Correct`

D would work too, since we are performing B in 2 lines rather than 1, `correct`

<!-- END QUESTION -->
