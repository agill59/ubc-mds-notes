# Submission 

When you are ready to submit your assignment do the following:

1. Run all cells in your notebook to make sure there are no errors by doing `Kernel -> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells...`
2. Enter Canvas and upload the assignment using Gradescope's drag and drop tool.
3. Don't forget to commit three times and push your work to GitHub.

## Question 1 - Computational Project Part 1: Environments and codebase

You will be creating a few files in here.
If you want you can choose to directly create them into an organized project with sub folders not or wait to do it later.
The points for project organization is later on in the lab.
The main benefit of doing it right away is that you will not need to check all the paths after you organize the project files.
But it's up to you on what order you want to work in.
The end result will be the same.

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

### 1.1 - Create data

`rubric={mechanics:1}`

Find or create any CSV dataset and add it to the repository. Only 1 dataset will be needed.
This can be downloaded from the internet,
created by hand,
loaded from a package and saved,
it doesn't matter.
You will load and perform an action on this dataset later.

Link to commit for the dataset below:

<https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab4_agill59/commit/f9781b1519f774ce4683324a5960a7cecea0639a>

<!-- END QUESTION -->

### 1.2 Edit the readme file

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

Edit the `README.md` file in the root of the lab repo.
Write a new bullet in the repo that contains:

- Name
- cwl
- What is a hobby of yours

In the space below put the name and a URL to the commit that has those changes. You only need to list the initial commit,
if you make changes to your response or `README.md` file later, you do not need to link to all the commits.

List link to commit below. Look into markdown notation of URLs to make sure your URL is clickable on render. (hint: `< >`)

<https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab4_agill59/commit/f511a791a42183d8fe621a82879014af4a73386b>

<!-- END QUESTION -->

## 1.3 Conda Environments

We will now work on creating a Python conda environment.

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

Add at least 1 package into the `environment.yml` file.
Add you name, cwl, and link to the commit into the assignment.
Only 1 link/commit needs to be listed,
if you add more later on, you do not need to do it.

Amar Gill, agill59, <https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab4_agill59/commit/3f9a453d5c83b04301c76a290789c8ffb2552000>

Link to your `environment.yml` below:

<https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab4_agill59/blob/master/environment.yml>

<!-- END QUESTION -->

### 1.4 Activate Environment

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

You should have an `environment.yml` file with at least 1 package listed.

Activate this environment and take a screen shot showing your prompt
before and after environment activation.
The screen shot should also show the output of `which python`
and it should all be consistent with the environment activated.

You will commit and push your screenshot to the repo and insert the
image using markdown or html syntax.
If your PDF does not render your image, you can provide a link to the screenshot.

Put your images or URLs below

![image.png](doc/1.4_image.png)

<!-- END QUESTION -->

## Question 2 - Scripts and Analysis Code

With your environment activated,
you will use the data and code in a collaborative environment.


### 2.1 Edit a script

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

There will be 1 analysis script. The name does not matter.

The final script will have following features:

1. Loads the dataset and performs any action on the loaded dataset
2. A function that is used from each package specified in the `environment.yml` file

The script does not need to be a full analysis of the loaded data.
The code in the script can be disjoint and independent from each function call.

We are looking to see if people can install an environment and edit a single script file.

Your script should run without errors.

_Each_ person will link to their script code below.
Provide name, cwl, and commit link.
If you make multiple edits, you only need to provide 1 commit URL.

Amar Gill, agill59, <https://github.ubc.ca/mds-2025-26/DSCI_521_lab4_agill59/commit/5a3519f237c44196cc628a0b989124a6e6ada032>

<!-- END QUESTION -->

## Question 3 - Project Organization

If you have not done so already,
we will not move all the files into something that will follow a data science project.


<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:1}`

Move all the images, scripts, and files you need such that it follows the folling format:
Yes, we are asking that you leave the original `lab4.ipynb` file in the root directory,
usually a file like this would go into `src`, `analysis`, or `docs` depending
on the project.

```markdown
lab4/
├── data/              # Dataset you are using in the repo
├── analysis/          # Code you are working on
├── doc/               # Rendered lab PDF
├── lab4.ipynb         # lab4.ipynb document
├── README.md          # README document you were asked to edit in the beginning
└── environment.yaml   # Environment file that is shared
```

Your final repo should be in this state.
We will be using the URL you provided at the top of the lab to check this question.

Idk what to put here :|

<!-- END QUESTION -->

## 4 - Project Check

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

We will now check that your code can run without error in the new organized project.
Jupyter notebooks have "magic" commands that begin with `%`.
`% run` is a jupyter notebook magic that allows you to "run" a script.
Below: provide a magic command that calls your collaborative script.
It should run without errors, and your rendered PDF should also render without errors.

The points here are all or nothing. This script either runs properly, or it doesn't.


```python
import IPython

%run analysis/test.py
```

    0       Quan
    1       Joel
    2    Tiffany
    3       Mike
    4      Arman
    Name: guest, dtype: object


<!-- END QUESTION -->

## 5 - Minimal Examples and Good Questions

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:4}`

Find a question asked by a student in a slack message,
this can be your own question or someone elses,
and critique how it can be a better question.

Commit the screenshot of the slack message and insert it into the cells below.
If your image does not render, provide a URL to the image in the repo.

![image.png](./image.png)

This question could be improved by reading the context of the question and phrasing it with more information. Asking "given that these are the current cases, should I add more?" could be more insightful for everyone involved and for those who need this later.

<!-- END QUESTION -->

## Challenge - Reinstall Miniforge and get a clean Base environment

<!-- BEGIN QUESTION -->

`rubric={mechanics:1.5}` (30 non challenge points)

Virtual environments will not be a key component to your data science career.
You should always be doing your work in a virtual environment,
and your base environment should always be clean and empty.

This will reduce a lot of confusion about what project and environment
you are working on.

You can reset your environment in one of 2 ways:

1. Re-install your Miniforge environment, such that your base environment is empty.
   You may choose to create a separate environment for your classes that use jupyter notebooks this block.
2. Revert your conda base environment to a specific "revision".

Provide the output of `conda list` to show that your base environment is activated
and that most of the typical data science packages are not installed in the base
environment.
